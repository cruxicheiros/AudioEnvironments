# AudioEnvironments
Creates a 3d audio environment with PyAL. 

## Usage
Run forest.py from the command line with 'python forest.py'.

Wear headphones while using AudioEnvironments. Make sure your sound is on and that your audio output is in stereo. Use the 'a' and 'd' keys to 'turn around' (this fuctionality is currently rather choppy, as you can only turn between 8 cardinal directions) and the 'p' button to quit.


## How to Run
You will need three things already installed: OpenAL, Python 3, and PyAL. Python 3 is available from here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/

and OpenAL is available from here:

https://www.openal.org/downloads/

and PyAL is available from here:

The number of dependencies this project has will decrease once I learn how to distribute them with AudioEnvironments.
