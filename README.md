# AudioEnvironments
Creates a 3d audio environment with PyAL. 

## How to Run
You will need three things already installed: OpenAL, Python 3, and PyAL. Python 3 is available from here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/

and OpenAL is available from here:

https://www.openal.org/downloads/

and PyAL is available from here:

http://pyal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

The number of dependencies this project has will decrease once I learn how to distribute them with AudioEnvironments.
